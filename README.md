# Grin GPU Miner for Windows (Linux)

Grin is currently planning PoW switch:

Testnet3: Cuckoo30 (this miner)
Testnet4: PLACEHOLDER Cuckatoo29 + PLACEHOLDER Cuckatoo30 (miner stops working)
Mainnet: Cuckatoo32+ for ASICS + TBD PoW for GPUs

GGM miner will stop working in T4 and may return for mainnet for one or both algorithms.

The miner is fully functional and uses our own (fastest known) algorithm. If you need a miner for your project, feel free to contact us.
