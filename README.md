# Grin GPU Miner for (mostly) Windows

## UPDATE: New OpenCL/CUDA noob frindly miner in January

Currently only supported cards are nvidia with at least 8GB of memory (6GB in the future). Miner can handle multiple cards at the same time in separate console windows - this helps with debugging each card. Supports all Grin pools, you can mine directly to a pool in just a few minutes. 

Best results are with RTX cards. AMD cards are expected to have similar power efficiency as nvidia, but will be slower at max power.
