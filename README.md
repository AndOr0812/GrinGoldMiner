# Grin GPU Miner for (mostly) Windows

## UPDATE: Miner will start working early December after Grin hard-fork

Currently only supported cards are nvidia with at least 8GB of memory. Miner can handle multiple cards at the same time in separate console windows - this helps with debugging each card.

For Grin main net, miner will support AMD cards and will have extra user friendliness. Best results are expected with RTX cards. AMD cards are expected to have similar power efficiency as nvidia, but will be slower at max power.
