# Grin GPU Miner for Windows (Linux)

This cuckoo cycle miner is no longer being developed since Grin project moves to equihash PoW variant as primary non-asic hashpower. It can still be used for testing on testnet3.

--------------------

The miner is fully functional and uses our own (fastest known) algorithm. Cuckoo cycle can be further enhanced to be CPU friendly or asic-resistant. If you need a miner for your project, feel free to contact us.
